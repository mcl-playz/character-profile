        Among those who live along the riverbank or in the Wild Wood, Badger is universally respected. No one dares go
        against what he says, and even poor animals like the young hedgehogs like and respect Badger, and trust that if
        they ever need a warm meal or refuge from the cold, Badger will gladly help them, as he does with Mole on page
        34, “Warmth coming back to those toes of yours?”. We can see how Badger nurses Mole back to health after he
        arrived on his door in the middle of winter with a broken leg. Badger is so respected in the community that he
        can effectively do whatever he likes.
